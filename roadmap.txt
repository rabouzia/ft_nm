Roadmap for Recreating the nm Command
Phase 1: Understand the Basics (Week 1)

    Get Comfortable with C Programming
        Ensure that you’re familiar with key C concepts like pointers, structs, and file I/O.
        If needed, review C documentation and tutorials on memory management and low-level I/O.

    Learn Unix/Linux System Calls
        Focus on the system calls that you'll be allowed to use in your project:
            open(), close(), read(), write(), fstat(), mmap(), munmap()
        Why? These system calls will be the foundation for interacting with files and memory.
        Resources: Linux man pages for system calls

    Basic File I/O and Mapping
        Understand how to open, read, and write files using system calls.
        Learn how to map files into memory with mmap() and unmap them with munmap().

Phase 2: Deep Dive into ELF Files (Week 2)

    Study the ELF File Format
        Learn about the structure of an ELF file:
            ELF Header: Contains information about the file and section headers.
            Section Headers: Describes the various sections (e.g., symbol table, program code, data).
            Symbol Table: Holds the list of symbols used in the executable.
            String Table: Contains the names of symbols in the ELF file.
        Why? Understanding the format of ELF files is key to extracting and displaying symbols like nm does.
        Resources:
            ELF File Format (Wikipedia)
            ELF Specification

    ELF Header and Section Headers
        Study the ELF header to understand how sections are laid out.
        Focus on e_shoff (section header offset), e_shnum (number of section headers), and e_ident (identification field).
        Learn to parse and interpret the section header table.

Phase 3: Symbol Tables and Linking (Week 3)

    Learn About Symbol Tables
        Understand the symbol table's role in linking and dynamic loading.
        Explore the structure of symbol table entries, including symbol types, addresses, and binding.
        Learn about static vs. dynamic symbols and how they are handled in ELF files.
        Why? The main goal of nm is to list symbols, so understanding how they are structured is crucial.

    Parse the Symbol Table
        Learn to read the symbol table from the ELF file, including how to locate it using the section headers.
        Learn how to extract and display each symbol’s address, type, and name.
        Learn to use the string table to get symbol names from indices in the symbol table.
        Resources:
            Symbol Tables in ELF
            ELF Symbol Table Documentation

Phase 4: Hexadecimal and Low-Level Formatting (Week 4)

    Hexadecimal Representation
        Get comfortable with hexadecimal numbers and how to print them.
        Understand the purpose of displaying data in hex when dealing with memory and binary files (ELF files).
        Learn how to format and print data (like addresses and symbol offsets) in hexadecimal.

    Implement Hex Output Functions
        Write functions to print addresses, symbol types, and other relevant information in a human-readable format (using write() instead of printf()).
        Why? nm prints symbols and their associated addresses in hex format, so you’ll need to format output this way.

Phase 5: Implementing nm Logic (Week 5)

    Implement Basic nm Command
        Start by reading the ELF file and verifying it’s a valid ELF file (check the magic number).
        Extract and display basic ELF header information, including entry point, section headers, and symbol table locations.
        Goal: Make sure you can open the ELF file, map it into memory, and extract key metadata (e.g., section headers).

    Display Symbols
        Parse and display the symbol table.
        Show each symbol’s address, type (e.g., function, object), and name.
        Filter symbols as needed (e.g., only display global symbols).
        Goal: Implement the core functionality of nm by listing symbols with proper formatting.

Phase 6: Handling Dynamic Symbols and Advanced Features (Week 6)

    Handle Dynamic Symbols
        Understand how nm differentiates between static and dynamic symbols.
        Learn to parse dynamic symbol tables (if applicable).
        Why? For more advanced nm functionality, you'll need to be able to recognize and display dynamic symbols correctly.

    Explore nm Options
        Add support for nm options (e.g., -g for global symbols, -n for sorting symbols by address).
        Understand how options change the display format (e.g., symbol sorting, filtering by type).
        Why? These options allow nm to give users a customized view of the symbols.

Phase 7: Testing, Debugging, and Refining (Week 7)

    Test on Real ELF Files
        Test your program with different ELF files: executables, object files, shared libraries.
        Handle edge cases like empty symbol tables, symbols with no names, and more.
        Debug and fix issues as they arise.

    Optimize and Refine the Code
        Optimize memory usage and make your program efficient.
        Handle errors gracefully and ensure your program works well on a variety of input files.
        Why? Thorough testing ensures your nm implementation is robust and reliable.

Phase 8: Documentation and Final Touches (Week 8)

    Document the Code
        Write documentation for your code, explaining how it works and how to use it.
        Add comments to your code to help others (and yourself) understand your implementation.
        Why? Good documentation is essential for maintaining and sharing your project.

    Prepare for Future Extensions
        Once your basic version of nm is working, consider adding more features or refactoring code for better performance.
        Potential future improvements could include handling more ELF section types, better error handling, or more advanced symbol filtering.
